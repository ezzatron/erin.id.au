              Hi! I&apos;m Erin, and I&apos;ve been making software for 20+
              years.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a proven track record of building and leading outstanding
              dev teams. My passion, dedication to quality, technical knowledge,
              and people skills have helped produce software that is both loved
              by users, and a joy to work on for the devs I work with.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a broad range of experience, particularly focused around
              front-end technologies, web apps, and user experience design, but
              also library, SDK, and tool development. I&apos;m also very
              passionate about the way in which software gets made â€” team
              structures, processes, tooling, and developer experience.

            <p>

              Tailwind, Go, gRPC, OpenAPI, JWTs, and Mapbox.
            </p>

            <p>
              I&apos;ve used Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, EKS, GitHub
              Actions, Playwright, Vitest, Jest, Git and Make to test, build,
              and deploy software.
            </p>

            <p>
              I&apos;ve worked on web apps, PWAs, web-based desktop apps,
              message-based apps, real-time apps, event-driven apps, APIs,
              microservices, and geolocation systems.
            </p>

              I have skills in team leadership, technical leadership, strategic
              planning, user experience, user interface design, developer
